# Cantonal reports

## Purpose: define the criteria for evaluating litter density at the cantonal level

### Lake Geneva, Valais, Vaud & Gen√®ve

This is in reply to issue 6 in the IQAASL repo [IQAASL](https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/IQAASL-End-0f-Sampling-2021). With the exception of the data from Plastock, all of the reports can be recreated from the original data set.

This has allowed us to redefine the pipeline for specific tasks at the regional level. In one sense this is redefining the form of IQAASL. The federal report should reflect the needs of the canton, here we attempt to define those needs.

This work follows previous work that was iniated from the IQAASL project:

1. The differences between sampling groups and the utility of sampling mix [Solid waste engineers](https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/solid-waste-team)
2. The probability of finding one object in the inventory [Finding one object](https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/finding-one-object)
3. The correlation of land use magnitude on litter density [Near or Far](https://github.com/hammerdirt-analyst/landuse)

There are many resources that we reference directly in the report. If you feel we have missed any please let us know.
